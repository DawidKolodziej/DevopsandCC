## DEVOPS In Businesses
### Why?

**DevOps describes a culture and set of processes that bring development and operations teams together to complete software development. It allows organizations to create and improve products at a faster pace than they can with traditional software development approaches.**

### Benefits:
- Shorter Development Cycles, Faster Innovation: With a combined development and operations team, applications are ready for use much more quickly. This is important, since companies succeed based on their ability to innovate faster than their competitors do

- Reduced Deployment Failures, Rollbacks, and Time to Recover: Part of the reason teams experience deployment failures is due to programming defects. The shorter development cycles with DevOps promote more frequent code releases. This, in turn, makes it easier to spot code defects. Therefore, teams can reduce the number of deployment failures using agile programming principles.

- Improved Communication and Collaboration: DevOps improves the software development culture. Combined teams are happier and more productive. The culture becomes focused on performance rather than individual goals. When the teams trust each other, they can experiment and innovate more effectively.

- Increased Efficiencies: Increased efficiency helps to speed the development process and make it less prone to error. There are ways to automate DevOps tasks. Continuous integration servers automate the process of testing code, reducing the amount of manual work required.

### Tools
Some Tools Include:
- Docker
- Git
- Jenkins
- Puppet

## Cloud Computing

### SAAS
- Software as a service (or SaaS) is a way of delivering applications over the Internet—as a service. Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management.

#### When to use
- Startups or small companies that need to launch ecommerce quickly and don’t have time for server issues or software
- Short-term projects that require quick, easy, and affordable collaboration
- Applications that aren’t needed too often, such as tax software
- Applications that need both web and mobile access

### PAAS
- Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with resources that enable you to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications.

#### When to use
-  PaaS can streamline workflows when multiple developers are working on the same development project. If other vendors must be included, PaaS can provide great speed and flexibility to the entire process. PaaS is particularly beneficial if you need to create customized applications.
-This cloud service also can greatly reduce costs and it can simplify some challenges that come up if you are rapidly developing or deploying an app.

### IAAS
- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the internet.
- A cloud computing service provider, such as Azure, manages the infrastructure, while you purchase, install, configure and manage your own software—operating systems, middleware and applications.

#### When to use
- Startups and small companies may prefer IaaS to avoid spending time and money on purchasing and creating hardware and software.
- Larger companies may prefer to retain complete control over their applications and infrastructure, but they want to purchase only what they actually consume or need.
- Companies experiencing rapid growth like the scalability of IaaS, and they can change out specific hardware and software easily as their needs evolve.

## Local, Hybrid, and Public?

### Public:
- Public clouds are the most common type of cloud computing deployment. The cloud resources (like servers and storage) are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the internet. 
- With a public cloud, all hardware, software, and other supporting infrastructure are owned and managed by the cloud provider. Microsoft Azure is an example of a public cloud.

**Advantages of public clouds:**

- Lower costs—no need to purchase hardware or software, and you pay only for the service you use.
- No maintenance—your service provider provides the maintenance.
- Near-unlimited scalability—on-demand resources are available to meet your business needs.
- High reliability—a vast network of servers ensures against failure.

### Private
- A private cloud consists of cloud computing resources used exclusively by one business or organization. 
- The private cloud can be physically located at your organization’s on-site datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider.

**Advantages of a private cloud:**

- More flexibility—your organization can customize its cloud environment to meet specific business needs.
- More control—resources are not shared with others, so higher levels of control and privacy are possible.
- More scalability—private clouds often offer more scalability compared to on-premises infrastructure.

### Hybrid 
- A hybrid cloud platform gives organizations many advantages—such as greater flexibility, more deployment options, security, compliance, and getting more value from their existing infrastructure.
- When computing and processing demand fluctuates, hybrid cloud computing gives businesses the ability to seamlessly scale up their on-premises infrastructure to the public cloud to handle any overflow—without giving third-party datacenters access to the entirety of their data. 
- Organizations gain the flexibility and innovation the public cloud provides by running certain workloads in the cloud while keeping highly sensitive data in their own datacenter to meet client needs or regulatory requirements.

**Advantages of the hybrid cloud:**

- Control—your organization can maintain a private infrastructure for sensitive assets or workloads that require low latency.
- Flexibility—you can take advantage of additional resources in the public cloud when you need them.
- Cost-effectiveness—with the ability to scale to the public cloud, you pay for extra computing power only when needed.
- Ease—transitioning to the cloud doesn’t have to be overwhelming because you can migrate gradually—phasing in workloads over time.
